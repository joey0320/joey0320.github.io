# Container Part 2
![Docker](/assets/docker_logo.png)

## Container Internals
![Docker Internals](/assets/DockerInternals.png)

## 1. client sends a request
- Uses REST API

## 2. Docker Daemon
- gets the request and figures out what the request is by using a routing table
- then pulls the image if the images is not in a local image repo
- converts the image into a OCI bundle
- responsible for
    - image management,
    - image builds
    - authentication
    - security
    - networking : when started, creates a default network bridge (docker0)
    - orchestration

## 3. Containerd
- interacts with the daemon with gRPC (CRUD style API)
- responsible for
    - container life cycle
    - execution logic of containers

## 4. runc
- cli that wraps around libcontainer
- interacts with the kernel to build the container
    - creates namespaces, cgroups

## 5. shim
- detaches the runc from containerd????

## 6. container
- child process of runc
- that is why containers have unique namespaces !! they are forks!!
