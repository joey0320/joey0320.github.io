<h2 id="1-what-is-a-container">1. What is a container</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although when using docker containers, it gives the the “illusion” of being inside a virtual machine. However, as will be explained, they are two very different technologies.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2-comparisons-with-vms">2. Comparisons with VMs</h2>
<ul>
  <li>it is lightweight compared to VMs
    <ul>
      <li>VM : run guest OS on top of host OS (hypervisor) to emulate guest OS behavior
        <ul>
          <li>HW -&gt; Host OS (Hypervisor) -&gt; VM (Guest OS + Application)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>container : use the host OS directly to provide isolation
        <ul>
          <li>HW -&gt; Host OS -&gt; Docker Engine -&gt; Container &amp; Application</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>a container is simpley a group of processes that are isolated!!!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3-then-how-does-containers-provide-isolation">3. Then how does containers provide isolation???</h2>
<ul>
  <li>they use linux namespaces and cgroups!!
    <ul>
      <li>although docker supports windows nowadays, I would rather stick to linux</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>linux namespaces
    <ul>
      <li>to understand linux namespaces, we need to understand the concept of “jail” first
        <ul>
          <li>imagine this file system /home/{bin, joonho}</li>
          <li>if i chroot to /home/joonho, the root will change to /home/joonho, and files from /joonho downwards in the fs will be inside a “jail”</li>
          <li>however, this jail does not provide good isolation since we can still access the / directory</li>
          <li>to provide a improved isolation, the linux namespace was introduced</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>there are mnt, pid, net, ipc, uts, user and cgroup namespaces</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>example (pid namespace)
<img src="/assets/pid_namespace.jpg" alt="pid namespace" />
    <ul>
      <li>in the host namespace, all process has pid 1 ~ 6</li>
      <li>in the client pid namespace, processes has pids 1 ~ 3</li>
      <li>when a container is created, a pid 1 process within the new pid namespace is created</li>
      <li>all process within the container is a descendent of pid 1 and thus within the created pid namespace, and hence obtains isolation from the host pid namespace</li>
      <li>similar for other namespaces</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
