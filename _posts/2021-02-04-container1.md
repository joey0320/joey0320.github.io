# Container Part 1 - Container basics
![Docker](/assets/docker_logo.png)


## 1. What is a container
- container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another

- Although when using docker containers, it gives the the "illusion" of being inside a virtual machine. However, as will be explained, they are two very different technologies.



## 2. Comparisons with VMs
- it is lightweight compared to VMs
    - VM : run guest OS on top of host OS (hypervisor) to emulate guest OS behavior
        - HW -> Host OS (Hypervisor) -> VM (Guest OS + Application)
    - container : use the host OS directly to provide isolation
        - HW -> Host OS -> Docker Engine -> Container & Application

- a container is simpley a group of processes that are isolated!!!



## 3. Then how does containers provide isolation???
- they use linux namespaces and cgroups!!
    - although docker supports windows nowadays, I would rather stick to linux
- linux namespaces 
    - to understand linux namespaces, we need to understand the concept of "jail" first
        - imagine this file system /home/{bin, joonho}
        - if i chroot to /home/joonho, the root will change to /home/joonho, and files from /joonho downwards in the fs will be inside a "jail"
        - however, this jail does not provide good isolation since we can still access the / directory
        - to provide a improved isolation, the linux namespace was introduced
    - there are mnt, pid, net, ipc, uts, user and cgroup namespaces

- example (pid namespace)
![pid namespace](/assets/pid_namespace.jpg)
    - in the host namespace, all process has pid 1 ~ 6
    - in the client pid namespace, processes has pids 1 ~ 3
    - when a container is created, a pid 1 process within the new pid namespace is created
    - all process within the container is a descendent of pid 1 and thus within the created pid namespace, and hence obtains isolation from the host pid namespace
    - similar for other namespaces
