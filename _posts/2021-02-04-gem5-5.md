# Event Driven Programming

## 1. Creating a event Callback

- In gem5â€™s event-driven model, each event has a callback function in which the event is processed. Generally, this is a class that inherits from :cppEvent. However, gem5 provides a wrapper function for creating simple events.

- declare event functions in ```hello_object.hh``` file

```cpp
class HelloObject : public SimObject
{
  private:
    // executed every time a event fires
    // must take no parameters and return nothing
    void processEvent();

    // add an event instance
    // use EventFunctionWrapper
    // enables us to execute any function
    EventFunctionWrapper event;

  public:
    HelloObject(HelloObjectParams *p);

    // added
    void startup();
};
```

- construct event in the constructor ```hello_object.cc```

```cpp
// EvenFunctionWrapper takes two arguments
// 1. a function to execute 
// type of std::function<void(void)> (e.g. lambda functions)
// 2. name

HelloObject::HelloObject(HelloObjectParams *params) :
    SimObject(params), event([this]{processEvent();}, name())
{
    DPRINTF(Hello, "Created the hello object\n");
}
```

- implement the process function 

```cpp
void
HelloObject::processEvent()
{
    DPRINTF(Hello, "Hello world! Processing the event!\n");
}
```

## 2. Scheduling Events

- Finally, for the event to be processed, we first have to schedule the event. For this we use the :cppschedule function. This function schedules some instance of an Event for some time in the future (event-driven simulation does not allow events to execute in the past).

- We will initially schedule the event in the startup() function we added to the HelloObject class. The startup() function is where SimObjects are allowed to schedule internal events. It does not get executed until the simulation begins for the first time (i.e. the simulate() function is called from a Python config file).

```cpp
void
HelloObject::startup()
{
    schedule(event, curTick() + 100);
}
```
