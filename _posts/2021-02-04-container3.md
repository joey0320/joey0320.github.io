# Container Part 3
![Docker](/assets/docker_logo.png)

## Docker github repo structure
- docker has many modules (cli, engine, containerd, runc, ...)
- they have divided the modules into different repositories

## moby/moby
- client cli
- docker daemon
- go here [moby-documentation](https://github.com/moby/moby/tree/master/docs/contributing) to see how to modify the docker daemon and test it!!

## moby/libnetwork
- networking api for docker
- go here [moby/libnetwork](https://github.com/moby/libnetwork) to see the repo

## containerd/containerd
- go here [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd) to see the repo

## opencontainers/runc
- go here [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc) to see the repo

## usage
- to test changes on the docker daemon : go to moby/moby repo and look at the documentation
- to test changes on containers : go to opencontainer/runc repo and look at the documentation 
- to do both(?) : make changes on runc, and change imports on the moby source code
